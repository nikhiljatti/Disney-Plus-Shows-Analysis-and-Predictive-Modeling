# Disney-Plus-Shows-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modeling

## Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze the dataset of Disney Plus shows and movies, and develop a predictive model to estimate the IMDb rating of these titles. The analysis covers various aspects of the dataset, including:

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handling missing values
Converting data types (e.g., converting 'imdb_votes' to numeric)
Preparing the data for further analysis and modeling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

## Descriptive statistics
Distribution plots for key features (IMDb rating, Metascore, runtime)
Genre analysis
Release date trends
Top directors and languages
Correlation analysis
Award analysis

## Predictive Modeling:
Selecting relevant features based on correlation analysis
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Implementing a Linear Regression model to predict IMDb ratings
Evaluating the model's performance using Mean Squared Error and R-squared

## Key Objectives:
Gain insights into the characteristics and trends of Disney Plus shows and movies.
Identify the most influential factors that contribute to the IMDb ratings of these titles.
Develop a predictive model that can estimate the IMDb rating of a Disney Plus title based on its features.
Provide recommendations or insights that could help Disney Plus optimize their content selection and curation.
